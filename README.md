# QR codes presentation

Welcome to the QR codes presentation, a web application built with Svelte, Firebase, Tailwind and DaisyUI to show a presentation of QR Codes programmed by the user for meeting or events

## Tech stack

- Svelte Framework: Leverage the power of the Svelte framework for building efficient and reactive user interfaces. The project structure is designed to help you organize your components, styles, and logic effectively.

- Firebase Integration: Easily connect your application to Firebase, a powerful backend-as-a-service platform. Utilize Firebase Authentication for user management, Firebase Realtime Database for real-time data synchronization, and Firebase Storage for storing user-generated content.

- Firestore Connectivity: Take advantage of Firestore, Firebase's cloud-based NoSQL database, to store structured data and enable seamless data synchronization across clients. The boilerplate provides examples of how to perform CRUD operations with Firestore.

- Tailwind CSS: Streamline your styling process with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Enjoy the benefits of pre-designed components and responsive design out of the box, while also being able to customize the design to fit your project's unique identity.

- Daisy UI Integration: Enhance your user interface with Daisy UI components, a set of responsive and elegant UI elements built on top of Tailwind CSS. These components facilitate the creation of visually appealing and functional user interfaces.
